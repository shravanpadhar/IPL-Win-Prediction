## Usage

Provide the following parameters to make a prediction:

| Parameter         | Description                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Batting Team     | The team currently batting                     |
| Bowling Team     | The bowling team                               |
| City             | Location of the match                          |
| Current Runs     | Runs scored by the batting team so far         |
| Overs Completed  | Number of overs completed                      |
| Wickets          | Wickets lost by the batting team               |
| Target Runs      | Total runs set by the bowling team             |

The predictor will use these inputs and its logistic regression model to compute the probability of the batting team winning.
